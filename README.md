Fuzzy Factory Data analysis using MySQL  
Dataset was created using the "createmavenfuzzyfactory" file in this project

** Traffic Analysis & Optimization

In this section I use MySQL to analyze where our website traffic is coming from, how different sources perform in terms of traffic volume and conversion rates, and how I can adjust bids to optimize our budgets.



** Website Measurement & Testing

In this section I will dive into page-level website data to compare traffic and conversion rates and use MySQL to build and analyze conversion funnels to help optimize the customer purchase experience.



** MID-COURSE PROJECT: Preparing data for the executive board meeting



** Channel Analysis & Optimization

In this section Iâ€™ll dig deeper into our traffic channel mix, explore paid vs. free traffic, break down performance by device type, and write advanced SQL queries to conduct some time-series analyses to understand trending and seasonality.



** Product-Level Analysis

In this section I will use MySQL to break down product-level sales and conversion rates, analyze cross-selling patterns, and use refund rates to keep a pulse on quality.



** User-Level Analysis

In this section I will take a closer look at user behavior and repeat sessions and use MySQL techniques to identify our most valuable customers and explore which channels they are coming from.



*** FINAL PROJECT: Building a data-driven growth story for potential investors
